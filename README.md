TouchTreeGrid
=============

TouchTreeGrid is an extremely versatile and easy to implement Sencha Touch 2.1x custom component that supports
Tree and Accordion grid view layouts.  It was designed after Mitchell Simoen's Ext.ux.touch.grid component.
TouchTreeGrid utilizes Senchaâ€™s Ext.dataview.List component and Disclosure events are supported for leafs
and optionally for category rows.

TouchTreeGrid was developed entirely within Sencha Architect (v2.2) designer product.  An Architect component
is provided for import into your toolbox (TouchTreeGrid.xdc).  Using Sencha Architect you can implement
this component for new grid implementations very rapidly.  Both basic and advanced examples are included
in the download.  Scrolling and overall functionality was found to be very fast for a larger data example
containing +3000 rows and 3 category levels .
