TouchTreeGrid and CalendarPicker
================================
(Touch 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)

TouchTreeGrid is an extremely versatile and easy to implement Sencha Touch custom 
component that supports Tree Grids, Standard Grids and traditional Accordion view layouts
(all by the same component).  Column sorting and custom data renderings such as comma
formatting, currency, percents and custom colors for negative vs. positive values are included.
TouchTreeGrid utilizes Senchaâ€™s Ext.dataview.List component and Disclosure events are
supported for leafs and optionally for category rows.   

CalendarPicker component utilizes TouchTreeGrid to provide incredible flexibility for date 
selection and calendar display on Phones and Tablets.  Calendars can be implemented with
just a few configurations in overlay panels or traditional containers.  International 
Calendars are supported with 44 different languages included in the download.  Calendar is 
constructed using #months backward to #months forward configurations.  Many features
exist including:  collapsible months for rapid single select, range select in single
calendar popup, or multi-select random dates in single popup.  Specific dates can be
disabled from selection.  Customizable styling exists for holidays, weekends, selected
days, disabled days and custom days.  Custom filters can be
easily applied to only display specific months highlighting important upcoming dates.  
Day planner support is partially implemented and will be forthcoming.  

TouchTreeGrid and CalendarPicker were developed entirely within Sencha Architect designer product and
can also be used without Architect.  Architect components are provided for import into
your toolbox (TouchTreeGrid.xdc, CalendarPicker.xdc).
