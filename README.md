TouchTreeGrid
=============

TouchTreeGrid is an extremely versatile and easy to implement Sencha Touch 2.1x, 2.2+ custom 
component that supports Tree Grids, Standard Grids and traditional Accordion view layouts
(all by the same component).  Column sorting and custom data renderings such as comma
formatting, currency, percents and custom colors for negative vs. positive values are included.
TouchTreeGrid utilizes Senchaâ€™s Ext.dataview.List component and Disclosure events are
supported for leafs and optionally for category rows. 

TouchTreeGrid was developed entirely within Sencha Architect designer product and
can also be used without Architect.  An Architect component is provided for import into
your toolbox (TouchTreeGrid.xdc - Sencha Architect Version: 2.2.2 Build: 971).
Using Sencha Architect you can implement this component
for new grid implementations very rapidly.  Both basic and advanced examples are included
in the download.   Scrolling and overall functionality was found to be very fast for a
larger data example containing +3000 rows and 3 category levels .
