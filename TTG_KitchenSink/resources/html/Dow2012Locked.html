<div>DOW 2012 Locked Columns Example</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-size: .8em; max-width: 75% !important;">

<p>>Class Name: TouchTreeGrid.view.Dow2012LockedCont</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>>Standard Grid example (simplGrid=true) with custom thumb to resize locked columns width.  A red vertical line is moved with the thumb until drag has ended, then the grid is resized appropriately. Tap on headers for column sort (styled as shaded).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>>Multiple locked column sections can be implemented simply by instantiating new instances of TouchTreeGrid for specific columns and referencing the same Store/TreeStore.  Refer to TTG_LockedColumns.pdf found in TTG_Locked Columns project directory for more details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>>Widths should be specified in pixels, em's or rem's for the scrolling columns.  Percents can be  used for the locked columns.  However, pixels are required for locked grid widths when thumbs are implemented</p>	
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>>Recommended configs for grid with locked columns:  width/minWidth a little large than total sum of column widths for right padding</p>	
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>>Recommended configs for horizontal scrolling grid:  TreeGrids -> arrowPctWidth='0', categIndentPct: '0', includeFooterLevels=false, hideExpandCollapseBtns=true.  TreeGrids and Simple Grids -> flex=1, width/minWidth a little large than total sum of column widths for right padding   </p>	
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>>Recommended configs for all grids:  variableHeights: false</p>	
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All freeze and horizontal scrolling column sets should have single ultimate parent container with layout='hbox' and itemId.  This itemId will be referenced in all displayed grids using linkedGridsParentItemId config.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>>Each individual Horizontal scrolling column set should have parent container with Layout='hbox' and scrollable = {direction: 'horizontal', directionLock: true}}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each fixed and scrolling sets of columns should have config linkedGridsArr[] defined which specifies the itemId's of all the OTHER participating grids</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Default thumbConfig overridden for this example to render Ext.Button with Fonts Awesome image font.  Note:  methods and configs defined to support both drag and dragend events.  The default behaviour updates the grid only upon dragend for optimal performance on mobile devics.</p>
