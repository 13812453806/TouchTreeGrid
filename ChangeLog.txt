6/2/2013 COMMIT CHANGE LOG:
Summary: Multiple new Features and Examples.

*** MODIFICATIONS THAT REQUIRE UPDATES TO PRIOR IMPLEMENTATIONS ***
 - Renamed "./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/" directory to "./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_22/"
   as this will always contain the latest version of Touch 2.2x  (currently 2.2.1)
   
 - Add following CSS selector to your TouchTreeGrid.css file
   (or simply replace your version with one in download as any
    custom CSS changes should really be done on your custom CSS file anyway):
     .x-touchtreegrid-list .touchtreegrid-header-cell {
        white-space: nowrap;
        overflow: hidden;
        text-overflow: clip; 
     }   
-  In TouchTreeGrid.css removed the string 'LEFT CENTER' from end of
   'background' attribute in selectors: 
      '.x-touchtreegrid-list .x-grid-sort-desc'
      '.x-touchtreegrid-list .x-grid-sort-asc '
    (again, if you never change this file and only
     update your custom CSS file you can simply overlay the new file)    
     
- Add 'display: -webkit-box;-webkit-box-orient: horizontal;' to 
  following configs if these configs are customized in any linked instances of 
  TouchTreeGrid (not common):
  styleContentRow, styleCategRow, styleHeaderRow
  Note:  This style string is now the default for any future implementations. 
  
- Changed default for landscapeIcon config from './resources/images/Recycle.png' to ''
  If anyone was using the feature to display this icon when their phone was rotated
  to landscape position, they will need to redefine it for their linked instances.
  This is more of a nice-to-have feature and should not be a required resource for new implementations.

- Changed default data type for 'store' config from OBJECT to STRING.  
  Doesn't seem like Architect will allow entry of Ext.create.store(....) statements
  (or functions returning this) in an object as I was hoping. 
  Keeping the type as string will simplify use for most users going forward.
  I'm not expecting this to impact pre-existing implementations.  You can check
  store config in your generated views after upgrading the component and saving to see if anything
  was corruptted in the config and fix it back in Architect if ncecessary.
  

*** MODIFICATIONS TO TOUCH 2.2x AND 2.1x TOUCHTREEGRID VERSION COMPONENTS ***
 - TouchTreeGrid.xdc components (Touch 2.2x and 2.1x versions) converted to latest
   Architect Version: 2.2.2 Build: 991
 
 - Added config arrowPctWidth (default = 4%) to allow control over percent screen width
   that category arrow consumes (example: tablet configs would want to use less width ... 2%)
   Updated methods accordingly: updateColumns() and doRefreshList()
   
 - Added CSS selector "touchtreegrid-header-cell" to construction of Header cells
   and added entry to TouchTreeGrid.css.  Updated handleColumnSort() to reference this selector name.
   You can override via custom CSS file.
   Removed hardcoded styles in DIV statement within doRefreshList().
   Added width and max-width configs to defintion of header cell.
   
 - Added customColumnSortEvent config which if defined is the name of the event fired when
   handling column sort tap.  Built-in logic will be bypassed.  This allows for custom
   column sort functionality without modifying the component.  Example would be when
   sort needs to occur on the server-side or to toggle between more states:
   ASC, DESC, ABS(ASC), ABS(DESC), etc...  Refer to logic in 
   handleColumnSort() for parameters passed with event.
   
 - Modified handleColumnSort() to apply following new configs on the sorted column (if defined):
   styleSorted, categStyleSorted, headerStyleSorted
   
 - New config: categColumns[] (refer to example Lists=> Grouper2)
   This allows for separate definition of Category columns from Detail row columns.  
   I originally wanted to support this as an array of array (i.e. different configs for 
   each category level), but ran into performance issues and backed out the code to 
   only support one CategColumns config for all levels.  Since category rows share the
   same dataIndex, you can still populate and customize the display for each level to
   some extent.
   Note on implementation:  If updating categColumns[] in controller code, you MUST update 
   this config before updating columns[] config.  If you update categColumns[] within your
   linked view instance than order doesn't matter.
   
 - TouchTreeGrid styleContentRow config defaulted to 'display: -webkit-box;-webkit-box-orient: horizontal;' instead
   of hardcoding in updateColumns() method.  This allows for more developer control.  If custom styles
   were added via styleContent in  linked instances then those definitions need to be modified to include the "display.."
   string to function the same as before.  Note:  styleContentRow for TaskList example had to be modified
   as a result of this.
   
 - Same change made to styleContentRow and styleHeaderRow configs for same reason.   Updates are required to 
   linked instances to include 'display: -webkit-box;-webkit-box-orient: horizontal;' if either of these configs
   were previously used.
 
 - Added disableExpandCollapse config if it is desired to prevent expand/collapse when category rows pressed
  (default = false) for backward compatibility.  Note:  'nodeItemTap' event will still be fired.
   Modified onItemTap() method accordingly. Note:  expand/collapse buttons on footer will not be disabled
   in event this feature is still desired.
   
 - Removed 'height : 1.6em;' from '.x-touchtreegrid-list .touchtreegrid-header' selector in TouchTreeGrid.css
   to avoid confusion as Header heights can only be modified using header{} object in linked instance currently.
 



5/15/2013 Commit Change Log:
Summary: Sorting enhancement for grouped rows + New 2.2 Examples

Touch 2.2 modifications(./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/ directory):

Modifications to 2.2 and 2.1 TouchTreeGrid components (all changes backward compatible)
 - Created new version of Touch 2.2 architect component:  TouchTreeGrid.xdc
 - Backward compatible mods to handleColumnSort() method within
   TouchTreeGrid component to support column sorting within
   Store Grouper rows.
 - Changed TouchTreeGrid layout from FIT to VBOX and height = '100%' is default
   when creating List component (this allows us to specify widths in pixels/em's
   to support Horiz scrolling .. if not defined than width = 100% is implied)
 - When creating list within updateStore() method, added logic to apply
   following configs to List component if defined in linked TouchTreeGrid 
   instance:  width, minWidth, height, minHeight
   (width, minWidth, height must be specified in pixels/em's for Horiz scrolling) 
 
Modifications to 2.2 examples:   
 - Created ListsContainer.js to house all simple list examples
    "Basic"   - DOW Hist with shaded rows
    "Grouper" - "Basic" with row grouper and column sorting
                within each grouping
    "Horiz"   - Horizontal scrolling example

 - Added 'grouper' and 'YearMonth' fields to Dow2012 Model
 - Created Dow2012grouper Store defining grouper/sorter
 - Created Dow2012Horiz Store
 - Alternate shading to DOW History example via treegriddemo.css
   Note sporadic shading issue will be fixed 2.2.1 release:
   http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?253800-Sencha-2.1-List-Zebra-Stripes-Working-Incorrectly       
 - treegriddemo.css updated for Horiz scrolling example to 
   make cell height = 47 pixels matching item list height
   (.x-touchtreegrid-list-dow2012Horiz .touchtreegrid-simplelist-cell).
 - Modified onMainTabpanelActiveItemChange() in Controller to load 
   DOW History store when Lists tab clicked
 - Added onListsTabpanelActiveItemChange() in Controler to load
   data for List examples (if not already loaded).  Included
   Initialize() function to disable horizontal scrolling and 
   make grid width match screen width > original grid width (576 pixels)
 - Removed styleCategRow confiig from "Basic" as not applicable
 - singleExpand = false (ProjectContainer, itemId='example2B')
 - Fixed link to GITHUB link in README.md
 - Updated HELP HTML files
 - Updated "TouchTreeGrid - Documentation.pdf"
   
Touch 2.1 modifications(./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_21/ and
 ./TouchTreeGrid_Basic_21/ directories):
 - Updated Touch 2.1 architect component:  TouchTreeGrid.xdc
 - Refer to 2.2 for other component changes also made to 2.1 version.
 

5/6/2013 Commit Change Log:
NOTE:  Changes to Examples only...NO changes to TouchTreeGrid component in this commit.
Summary: Correct duplicate PullRefresh issue for DOW Hist example
 - Deleted TouchTreeGrid.xdc from parent directory to avoid confusion as each subdirectory
   contains Touch-specific versions:
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_21/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.1)
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Basic_21/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.1)
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.2)
 - ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/ modifications:
   > TouchTreeGrid.model.Dow2012 requires idProperty and unique values in store to prevent
     duplicates when refreshing data via PullRefresh
   > Replaced ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/data/dow2012.json to include unique ID values

5/4/2013 Commit Change Log:
Summary:  Modified PullRefresh implementation as Touch 2.2 removed support for refreshFn
 - Added pull refresh to dow2012 example (maintabpanel.js) via "listPlugins : {xclass: 'Ext.plugin.PullRefresh'}"
 - Replaced refreshFn event handling in example2 (ProjectContainer.js) with new Touch 2.2 event "latestfetched"
   via listPlugin config.  Workaround to snap list back after manually loading data for this example is 
   to modify loadExample2Store() function within TouchTreeGridController.js to pass scrollToY = 1 to
   loadStore() function to reset scroller after loading data.

 - Removed CSS for .touchtreegrid-disclose-spacer  as no longer needed
 - Added .x-list-disclosure:before selector to treegriddemo.css to disable arrow picto from overlaying Example #2 I-Phone style icon:

     content: '';
     font-family: '';
   }
 - Added Style: background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, rgb(86, 167, 223), rgb(43, 145, 215) 3%, rgb(33, 117, 175));
