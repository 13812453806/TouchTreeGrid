7/9/2013 COMMIT CHANGE LOG:
Summary: Minor updates to better support Dynamic grids and individual cell taps.

*** MODIFICATIONS THAT REQUIRE UPDATES TO PRIOR IMPLEMENTATIONS ***
  No configuration updates required.  All changes are backward compatible to prior release.

*** MODIFICATIONS TO TOUCH 2.2x TOUCHTREEGRID VERSION COMPONENT (2.1x version not updated) ***  
- updateStore() method modified to create temporary store if not defined within configuration 
  for purposes of supporting dynamic grids without requiring creation and reference to temporary store:
      if (newStore === "") {
        newStore = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {fields: {"name" : "dynamic"}});
      }  
  Store config removed from DOW2012 Dynamic example and DynamicStore.js removed from TTG_Slider and
  TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_22 projects (Store and Controller reference).
  
- Updated updateColumns() method to add 'dataIndex = "column name"' attribute to each cell DIV if columns
  array has addDataIndexToDiv=true config for that column.  This inserts unique identifier for each DIV representing
  the row and allows for trapping of unique cell tap (same method for how header cell tap works).
  Note I didn't want to pollute the DOM by globally adding this to DIV for all cells by default. 
  Added "addDataIndexToDiv: true" attribute to column[] array for Horizontal Scrolling and Dyunamic grid 
  examples (columns CloseDate and ClosePrice only).
  Refer to onHorizGridLeafItemTap() and onDynamicGridLeafItemTap() methods within ListsController
  (TTG_Slider and TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_22 projects)
  
- Refer to documenation "Lists => Horiz (DOW History Example with Horizontal Scrolling" (Program Flow section)
  on how to simulate a hyperlink substring within the text of a specific cell.

- Documenation updated per above.  Refer to "Appendix C - Upgrading TouchTreeGrid component" in 
  "TouchTreeGrid - Documentation.pdf" for how to upgrade your component within Architect.


6/18/2013 COMMIT CHANGE LOG:
Summary:  Fixed scrolling issue with Horiz and Dynamic examples.

- Deleted "height: 1000" config from all linked instances.
- Fixed minHeight issue when scrolling menu for Tablets after collapse
  followed by manual expand of each category
  

6/16/2013 COMMIT CHANGE LOG:
Summary: TouchTreeGrid as Slider Menu + TreeStore Filtering

NEW FEATURES AND EXAMPLES

   - New set of examples that utilize TouchTreeGrid component as 
     Accordion Slide Navigation Menu (i.e. Facebook style menu, but collapsible)
     for Phones and as scrolling collapsible category menu for Tablets.
        > All menu items easily defined in store 
        > Scrolling navigation menu with spring disabled such that user
          can not scroll past top or bottom of list.
   
   - Example of easy to implement TreeStore filter solution.  There are a few
     forum threads suggesting Sencha does not correctly support TreeStore filtering for
     Touch or EXTJS.  This example utilizes provided TreeStore generation algorithm
     to rebuild TreeStore from saved array applying custom filter conditions. 
       > Census Filter Ex#1
         (refer to "TouchTreeGrid - Documentation.pdf" for this example).
   
   - Examples of embedded images within grid cells
        > Sliding Menu => PNG file displayed on Category rows
        > Project Tree Examples => Project #3 displays checkmarks
          (Slide Navigation example only)
        
   - Example of leaf row rendering function using styleContentRow config:
        > Project Tree Examples => Project #3 rows shaded green where done
        > Use styleCategRow config to style category rows
   
   - Example of cell rendering function using CSS selector as opposed to Styles (Basic List #2).
     Allows red/green cells to display as white text with blue background when selected.
   
   - Added logic to differentiate handling of list disclose event vs. item tap as 
     tap of new Touch 2.2 disclosure icon triggers both events causing category rows 
     to expand/collapse when disclose event was intended.
     
   - Added logic to not allow expand/collapse of specific node if expandable=false
     for store defined node.
     
   - Support optional column[] array CLS references in lieu of Styles. Example:
     cls, sortedCls, categCls, categSortedCls, headerCls, headerSortedCls 
     instead of (or in addition to) existing style equivalents:
     style, styleSorted, categStyle, categStyleSorted, headerStyle, headerStyleSorted  
        > Lists => Dynamic
          Refer to ./data/dow2012dynamicCss.json for css-based column definitions
     
   - Support different CSS selectors for each category level.  
     Default selector is ".touchtreegrid-list-categ".  New config categCssArr[]
     allows for specification of different CSS selectors for each level in same
     way that categColorArr[] allows for basic color shading.
        > Projects => Ex #2
        > First category level in white italics using custom selector for that level.
          Remaining levels use default selector.

   - Corrected implementation of Grouper #2 example to work in Touch 2.2
     Issue found was that in 2.2 you can't use same Model for Store and a TreeStore
     (else you will observere strange behaviour when bouncing between two views
      configured as such)
         
   - All new Slider Menu examples found in ./TTG_Slider/ directory.
     Refer to "TouchTreeGrid - documentation.pdf" (Summary of Provided Examples) in download for
     further discussion on each of the examples.
    
   - "TouchTreeGrid - Documentation.pdf" updated for new examples and Slider Menu implementation.

*** MODIFICATIONS TO TOUCH 2.2x AND 2.1x TOUCHTREEGRID VERSION COMPONENTS ***
   - Provided Architect components generated using latest version of 
     Architect (v2.2.2 Build 991)
     
   - Added node.isExpandable() condition to onItemTap() method
     if (!disabledExpColl && node.isExpandable()) {
        
   - Added logic to onItemTap() method to ignore ItemTap if Disclose event processed
     Ref:  http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?261518-List-onItemDisclosure-ST-2.2

   - Added config categCssArr[] to allow different CSS selector for each category level.
     If not defined at all, or not for specific level then default 'touchtreegrid-list-categ' selector applied.
     
   - Added skipApplyDefaultCollapseLevel parameter to doRefreshList().  
     Added logic for columns.headerCss.
     Added logic to apply CSS to category rows by level if defined in categCssArr[] config. 
   
   - Added Ext.isEmpty() conditions to updateColumns() method to better handle missing column[] 
     array attributes.  Added logic for columns.css, columns.categCss, categColumns.css, categColumns.categCss.
     
   


*** Example Updates ***
 ./TTG_Slider/.
   - Added all new sliding mneu examples to this directory for both phone and tablet.
     Run app.html for Touch 2.2 and app21.html for Touch 2.1
   
 ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_22/.
   - Added examples Lists => Basic #2, Census => Census Filter Ex#1
   
 
6/2/2013 COMMIT CHANGE LOG:
Summary: Multiple new Features and Examples.

*** MODIFICATIONS THAT REQUIRE UPDATES TO PRIOR IMPLEMENTATIONS ***
 - Renamed "./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/" directory to "./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_22/"
   as this will always contain the latest version of Touch 2.2x  (currently 2.2.1)
   
 - Add following CSS selector to your TouchTreeGrid.css file
   (or simply replace your version with one in download as any
    custom CSS changes should really be done on your custom CSS file anyway):
     .x-touchtreegrid-list .touchtreegrid-header-cell {
        white-space: nowrap;
        overflow: hidden;
        text-overflow: clip; 
     }   
-  In TouchTreeGrid.css removed the string 'LEFT CENTER' from end of
   'background' attribute in selectors: 
      '.x-touchtreegrid-list .x-grid-sort-desc'
      '.x-touchtreegrid-list .x-grid-sort-asc '
    (again, if you never change this file and only
     update your custom CSS file you can simply overlay the new file)    
     
- Add 'display: -webkit-box;-webkit-box-orient: horizontal;' to 
  following configs if these configs are customized in any linked instances of 
  TouchTreeGrid (not common):
  styleContentRow, styleCategRow, styleHeaderRow
  Note:  This style string is now the default for any future implementations. 
  
- Changed default for landscapeIcon config from './resources/images/Recycle.png' to ''
  If anyone was using the feature to display this icon when their phone was rotated
  to landscape position, they will need to redefine it for their linked instances.
  This is more of a nice-to-have feature and should not be a required resource for new implementations.

- Changed default data type for 'store' config from OBJECT to STRING.  
  Doesn't seem like Architect will allow entry of Ext.create.store(....) statements
  (or functions returning this) in an object as I was hoping. 
  Keeping the type as string will simplify use for most users going forward.
  I'm not expecting this to impact pre-existing implementations.  You can check
  store config in your generated views after upgrading the component and saving to see if anything
  was corruptted in the config and fix it back in Architect if ncecessary.
  

*** MODIFICATIONS TO TOUCH 2.2x AND 2.1x TOUCHTREEGRID VERSION COMPONENTS ***
 - TouchTreeGrid.xdc components (Touch 2.2x and 2.1x versions) converted to latest
   Architect Version: 2.2.2 Build: 991
 
 - Added config arrowPctWidth (default = 4%) to allow control over percent screen width
   that category arrow consumes (example: tablet configs would want to use less width ... 2%)
   Updated methods accordingly: updateColumns() and doRefreshList()
   
 - Added CSS selector "touchtreegrid-header-cell" to construction of Header cells
   and added entry to TouchTreeGrid.css.  Updated handleColumnSort() to reference this selector name.
   You can override via custom CSS file.
   Removed hardcoded styles in DIV statement within doRefreshList().
   Added width and max-width configs to defintion of header cell.
   
 - Added customColumnSortEvent config which if defined is the name of the event fired when
   handling column sort tap.  Built-in logic will be bypassed.  This allows for custom
   column sort functionality without modifying the component.  Example would be when
   sort needs to occur on the server-side or to toggle between more states:
   ASC, DESC, ABS(ASC), ABS(DESC), etc...  Refer to logic in 
   handleColumnSort() for parameters passed with event.
   
 - Modified handleColumnSort() to apply following new configs on the sorted column (if defined):
   styleSorted, categStyleSorted, headerStyleSorted
   
 - New config: categColumns[] (refer to example Lists=> Grouper2)
   This allows for separate definition of Category columns from Detail row columns.  
   I originally wanted to support this as an array of array (i.e. different configs for 
   each category level), but ran into performance issues and backed out the code to 
   only support one CategColumns config for all levels.  Since category rows share the
   same dataIndex, you can still populate and customize the display for each level to
   some extent.
   Note on implementation:  If updating categColumns[] in controller code, you MUST update 
   this config before updating columns[] config.  If you update categColumns[] within your
   linked view instance than order doesn't matter.
   
 - TouchTreeGrid styleContentRow config defaulted to 'display: -webkit-box;-webkit-box-orient: horizontal;' instead
   of hardcoding in updateColumns() method.  This allows for more developer control.  If custom styles
   were added via styleContent in  linked instances then those definitions need to be modified to include the "display.."
   string to function the same as before.  Note:  styleContentRow for TaskList example had to be modified
   as a result of this.
   
 - Same change made to styleContentRow and styleHeaderRow configs for same reason.   Updates are required to 
   linked instances to include 'display: -webkit-box;-webkit-box-orient: horizontal;' if either of these configs
   were previously used.
 
 - Added disableExpandCollapse config if it is desired to prevent expand/collapse when category rows pressed
  (default = false) for backward compatibility.  Note:  'nodeItemTap' event will still be fired.
   Modified onItemTap() method accordingly. Note:  expand/collapse buttons on footer will not be disabled
   in event this feature is still desired.
   
 - Removed 'height : 1.6em;' from '.x-touchtreegrid-list .touchtreegrid-header' selector in TouchTreeGrid.css
   to avoid confusion as Header heights can only be modified using header{} object in linked instance currently.
 



5/15/2013 Commit Change Log:
Summary: Sorting enhancement for grouped rows + New 2.2 Examples

Touch 2.2 modifications(./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/ directory):

Modifications to 2.2 and 2.1 TouchTreeGrid components (all changes backward compatible)
 - Created new version of Touch 2.2 architect component:  TouchTreeGrid.xdc
 - Backward compatible mods to handleColumnSort() method within
   TouchTreeGrid component to support column sorting within
   Store Grouper rows.
 - Changed TouchTreeGrid layout from FIT to VBOX and height = '100%' is default
   when creating List component (this allows us to specify widths in pixels/em's
   to support Horiz scrolling .. if not defined than width = 100% is implied)
 - When creating list within updateStore() method, added logic to apply
   following configs to List component if defined in linked TouchTreeGrid 
   instance:  width, minWidth, height, minHeight
   (width, minWidth, height must be specified in pixels/em's for Horiz scrolling) 
 
Modifications to 2.2 examples:   
 - Created ListsContainer.js to house all simple list examples
    "Basic"   - DOW Hist with shaded rows
    "Grouper" - "Basic" with row grouper and column sorting
                within each grouping
    "Horiz"   - Horizontal scrolling example

 - Added 'grouper' and 'YearMonth' fields to Dow2012 Model
 - Created Dow2012grouper Store defining grouper/sorter
 - Created Dow2012Horiz Store
 - Alternate shading to DOW History example via treegriddemo.css
   Note sporadic shading issue will be fixed 2.2.1 release:
   http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?253800-Sencha-2.1-List-Zebra-Stripes-Working-Incorrectly       
 - treegriddemo.css updated for Horiz scrolling example to 
   make cell height = 47 pixels matching item list height
   (.x-touchtreegrid-list-dow2012Horiz .touchtreegrid-simplelist-cell).
 - Modified onMainTabpanelActiveItemChange() in Controller to load 
   DOW History store when Lists tab clicked
 - Added onListsTabpanelActiveItemChange() in Controler to load
   data for List examples (if not already loaded).  Included
   Initialize() function to disable horizontal scrolling and 
   make grid width match screen width > original grid width (576 pixels)
 - Removed styleCategRow confiig from "Basic" as not applicable
 - singleExpand = false (ProjectContainer, itemId='example2B')
 - Fixed link to GITHUB link in README.md
 - Updated HELP HTML files
 - Updated "TouchTreeGrid - Documentation.pdf"
   
Touch 2.1 modifications(./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_21/ and
 ./TouchTreeGrid_Basic_21/ directories):
 - Updated Touch 2.1 architect component:  TouchTreeGrid.xdc
 - Refer to 2.2 for other component changes also made to 2.1 version.
 

5/6/2013 Commit Change Log:
NOTE:  Changes to Examples only...NO changes to TouchTreeGrid component in this commit.
Summary: Correct duplicate PullRefresh issue for DOW Hist example
 - Deleted TouchTreeGrid.xdc from parent directory to avoid confusion as each subdirectory
   contains Touch-specific versions:
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_21/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.1)
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Basic_21/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.1)
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.2)
 - ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/ modifications:
   > TouchTreeGrid.model.Dow2012 requires idProperty and unique values in store to prevent
     duplicates when refreshing data via PullRefresh
   > Replaced ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/data/dow2012.json to include unique ID values

5/4/2013 Commit Change Log:
Summary:  Modified PullRefresh implementation as Touch 2.2 removed support for refreshFn
 - Added pull refresh to dow2012 example (maintabpanel.js) via "listPlugins : {xclass: 'Ext.plugin.PullRefresh'}"
 - Replaced refreshFn event handling in example2 (ProjectContainer.js) with new Touch 2.2 event "latestfetched"
   via listPlugin config.  Workaround to snap list back after manually loading data for this example is 
   to modify loadExample2Store() function within TouchTreeGridController.js to pass scrollToY = 1 to
   loadStore() function to reset scroller after loading data.

5/3/2013 Commit Change Log:
 - Touch 2.2 code version contained in subdirectory:  ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/

 - Removed CSS for .touchtreegrid-disclose-spacer  as no longer needed
 - Added .x-list-disclosure:before selector to treegriddemo.css to disable arrow picto from overlaying Example #2 I-Phone style icon:
   .x-touchtreegrid-list-example2 .x-list-disclosure:before{  
     content: '';
     font-family: '';
   }
 - Added Style: background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, rgb(86, 167, 223), rgb(43, 145, 215) 3%, rgb(33, 117, 175));
