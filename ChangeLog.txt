Summary: Correct duplicate PullRefresh issue for DOW Hist example
 - Deleted TouchTreeGrid.xdc from parent directory to avoid confusion as each subdirectory
   contains Touch-specific versions:
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_21/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.1)
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Basic_21/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.1)
     ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/TouchTreeGrid.xdc (Touch 2.2)
 - ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/ modifications:
   > TouchTreeGrid.model.Dow2012 requires idProperty and unique values in store to prevent
     duplicates when refreshing data via PullRefresh
   > Replaced ./TouchTreeGrid_Advanced_220/data/dow2012.json to include unique ID values

5/4/2013 Commit Change Log:
Summary:  Modified PullRefresh implementation as Touch 2.2 removed support for refreshFn
 - Added pull refresh to dow2012 example (maintabpanel.js) via "listPlugins : {xclass: 'Ext.plugin.PullRefresh'}"
 - Replaced refreshFn event handling in example2 (ProjectContainer.js) with new Touch 2.2 event "latestfetched"
   via listPlugin config.  Workaround to snap list back after manually loading data for this example is 
   to modify loadExample2Store() function within TouchTreeGridController.js to pass scrollToY = 1 to
   loadStore() function to reset scroller after loading data.
